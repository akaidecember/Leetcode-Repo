# Description
# You are given an integer
# num
# . You will apply the following steps to
# num
# two
# separate times:
# Pick a digit
# x (0 <= x <= 9)
# .
# Pick another digit
# y (0 <= y <= 9)
# . Note
# y
# can be equal to
# x
# .
# Replace all the occurrences of
# x
# in the decimal representation of
# num
# by
# y
# .
# Let
# a
# and
# b
# be the two results from applying the operation to
# num
# independently
# .
# Return
# the max difference
# between
# a
# and
# b
# .
# Note that neither
# a
# nor
# b
# may have any leading zeros, and
# must not
# be 0.
# Example 1:
# Input:
# num = 555
# Output:
# 888
# Explanation:
# The first time pick x = 5 and y = 9 and store the new integer in a.
# The second time pick x = 5 and y = 1 and store the new integer in b.
# We have now a = 999 and b = 111 and max difference = 888
# Example 2:
# Input:
# num = 9
# Output:
# 8
# Explanation:
# The first time pick x = 9 and y = 9 and store the new integer in a.
# The second time pick x = 9 and y = 1 and store the new integer in b.
# We have now a = 9 and b = 1 and max difference = 8
# Constraints:
# 1 <= num <= 10
# 8

class Solution:
    def maxDiff(self, num: int) -> int:
        mx,mn=str(num),str(num)
        
        j=0
        while mx[j]=='9' and j<len(mx)-1:
            j+=1
        mx=mx.replace(mx[j],'9')

        for i in range(len(mn)):
            if i==0:
                if mn[i]!='1':
                    mn=mn.replace(mn[i],'1')
                    break
            else:
                if mn[i]!='0' and mn[i]!=mn[0]:
                    mn=mn.replace(mn[i],'0')
                    break

        return int(mx)-int(mn)
