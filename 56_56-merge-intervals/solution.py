# Description
# Given an array of
# intervals
# where
# intervals[i] = [start
# i
# , end
# i
# ]
# , merge all overlapping intervals, and return
# an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input
# .
# Example 1:
# Input:
# intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
# Output:
# [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
# Explanation:
# Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
# Example 2:
# Input:
# intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
# Output:
# [[1,5]]
# Explanation:
# Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
# Constraints:
# 1 <= intervals.length <= 10
# 4
# intervals[i].length == 2
# 0 <= start
# i
# <= end
# i
# <= 10
# 4

class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        n = len(intervals)
        intervals.sort()
        ret = []

        for i in range(n):
            if not ret or intervals[i][0] > ret[-1][1]:
                ret.append(intervals[i])
            else:
                ret[-1][1] = max(intervals[i][1], ret[-1][1])
            
        return ret
